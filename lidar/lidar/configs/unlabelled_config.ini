[ToolTips]
eps = <b>eps</b>: defines the distance to neighbors in a cluster
min_points = <b>min_points</b>: defines the minimum number of points required to form a cluster
uniform_down_k_point = <b>uniform_down_k_point</b>: Sample rate, the selected point indices are [0, k, 2k, â€¦]
distance_threshold = <b>distance_threshold</b>: defines the maximum distance a point can have to an estimated plane to be considered an inlier.
ground_threshold = <b>ground_threshold</b>: magic number that defines the distance threshold in which the points within it will be considered as ground.
rgbvi_threshold = <b>rgbvi_threshold</b>: magic number (-1.0 to 1.0) that defines what value is high enough to be considered as green space.
